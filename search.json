    "section": "",
    "text": "It would be difficult to offer a dissenting opinion to Messi being the greatest soccer player in the 21st century, and potentially of all time. The Argentine winger took on a new and historical challenge by moving to Miami in the Summer of 2023 to play in Major League Soccer.\nHis first appearance in July of 2023 provided a marquee MLS moment where he scored a game-winning free kick in the final moments of a Leagues Cup bout versus Cruz Azul. From that moment on, expectations were high for his first full season in 2024.\nTo put the basic stats forward, Messi had a historically good season. He had 20 goals and 16 assists.\nThe resounding issue for the critics of his MVP award was that he only played 19 games in the season due to a mid-season ankle injury at Copa America. For those that are new to the league, the regular season is 34 games.\nThe question becomes clear: Did Messi prove enough in 19 games to be the true MLS MVP?\nThe first sample size will be the 2024 MLS Designated Players. These players’ salaries can exceed the salary cap of MLS which usually consists of the MLS MVP seasonally.\nHow balanced and efficient was Messi in creating assists and goals when he had the chances to do so?\nTo look at this, a stat ratio for assist and goal efficiency would be most effective. Goal efficiency is goals to expected goals (xG) and assist efficiency is assists to progressive passes.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(ggrepel)\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nbadmls &lt;- read_csv(\"mls_players_2024.csv\")\n\nmls &lt;- badmls |&gt; separate(nation, into=c(\"ab\", \"nation\"), sep=\" \") \n\nmlsdp &lt;- mls |&gt; \n  c(\"Alexey Miranchuk\", \"Bartosz Slisz\", \"Osman Bukari\", \"Sebastián Driussi\", \"Liel Abada\", \"Pep Biel\", \"Karol Swiderski\", \"Hugo Cuypers\", \"Gastón Giménez\", \"Luciano Acosta\", \"Nicholas Gioacchini\", \"Obinna Nwobodo\", \"Kévin Cabral\", \"Djordje Mihailovic\", \"Rafael Navarro\", \"Cucho Hernández\", \"Darlington Nagbe\", \"Diego Rossi\", \"Jesús Ferreira\", \"Petar Musa\", \"Christian Benteke\", \"Mateusz Klich\", \"Matti Peltola\", \"Sebastián Ferreira\", \"Héctor Herrera\", \"Ezequiel Ponce\", \"Erik Sviatchenko\", \"Alan Pulido\", \"Nemanja Radoja\", \"Dániel Sallói\", \"Gabriel Pec\", \"Riqui Puig\", \"Dénis Bouanga\", \"Olivier Giroud\", \"Sergio Busquets\", \"Lionel Messi\", \"Joaquín Pereyra\", \"Teemu Pukki\", \"Kelvin Yeboah\", \"Victor Wanyama\", \"Hany Mukhtar\", \"Sam Surridge\", \"Walker Zimmerman\", \"Tomás Chancalay\", \"Carles Gil\", \"Giacomo Vrioni\", \"Talles Magno\", \"Thiago Martins\", \"Santiago Rodríguez\", \"Felipe Carballo\", \"Emil Forsberg\", \"Dante Vanzeir\", \"Luis Muriel\", \"Martín Ojeda\", \"Facundo Torres\", \"Dániel Gazdag\", \"Mikael Uhre\", \"Evander\", \"Jonathan Rodríguez\", \"Diogo Gonçalves\", \"Cristian Arango\", \"Cristian Espinoza\", \"Carlos Gruezo\", \"Hernán López\", \"Pedro de la Vega\", \"Raúl Ruidíaz\", \"Albert Rusnák\", \"Marcel Hartel\", \"João Klauss\", \"Lorenzo Insigne\", \"Richie Laryea\", \"Stuart Armstrong\", \"Andrés Cubas\", \"Ryan Gauld\")\n\ndesignated &lt;- mls |&gt; \n  filter(player %in% mlsdp)\n\ndpeff &lt;- designated |&gt; \n  mutate(\n    a_eff = ast/prg_p,\n    g_eff = gls/x_g)\n\nmessi &lt;- dpeff |&gt; \n  filter(player == \"Lionel Messi\")\n\nsergio &lt;- dpeff |&gt; \n  filter(player == \"Sergio Busquets\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_point(\n    data=dpeff, \n    aes(x=g_eff, y=a_eff, size=mp),\n    alpha = .3) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=messi, \n    aes(x=g_eff, y=a_eff, size=mp), \n    color= \"#F7B5CD\") +\n  scale_size(range = c(0, 3), name=\"starts\") +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 0.9770309, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_hline(yintercept=0.04695493, color=\"red\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=2.5, y=0.2, label=\"In-form attack\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text(aes(x=0.25, y=0.02, label=\"Out-of-form attack\"), color=\"blue\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=messi, \n    aes(x=g_eff, y=a_eff, label=player, nudge_x = 2)\n  ) +\n  geom_point(\n    data=sergio, \n    aes(x=g_eff, y=a_eff, size=mp), \n    color= \"#F7B5CD\") +\n  geom_text_repel(\n    data=sergio, \n    aes(x=g_eff, y=a_eff, label=player, nudge_y = 0.04)\n  ) +\nlabs(\n    x=\"Goal Efficiency (Goals/xG)\", \n    y=\"Assist Efficiency (Assists/Progressive Passes)\", \n    title=\"MLS DP Efficiency\", \n    subtitle=\"The 2024 MLS MVP compared to &lt;span style = 'color:red;'&gt;average DPs&lt;/span&gt; is.\", \n    caption=\"Source: Football Reference | Chase Ruch\",\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size=16)) +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nIf one looks at Messi within the “in-form attack” segement, it is clear that he is the most balanced in-form player that favors goal scoring (LA Galaxy’s Riqui Puig is the closest to rival him). The most interesting part is his teammate (at both Inter Miami and Barcelona) Sergio Busquets was significantly more efficient in front of goal than Messi last season. The caveat is that the midfielder did not dish out assists as efficiently as he typically did in the past.\nThe next rebuttal to come from the critics is the penalty argument. A social media phenomenon is the phrase “Pessi.” This is essentially a slang term showing that Messi is helped by his teammates and referees to get goal scoring opportunities at the penalty spot.\nJust recently in April viewers saw a “Pessi” flag at BMO Stadium in Los Angeles before a match against LAFC, mocking the World Cup winner. This is an ongoing fight against his legitimacy that is particularly fueled in the Messi versus Cristiano Ronaldo debate.\nSo, did Mr. Messi prove the doubters wrong? Did he rely on penalties to get the MVP award to his name? Time to narrow this down to the MVP finalists.\n\n\nCode\nvote &lt;- mls |&gt; \n  filter(player %in% c(\"Lionel Messi\", \"Cucho\", \"Evander\", \"Christian Benteke\", \"Luis Suárez\"))\n\nxgmvp &lt;- vote |&gt; \n  select(player, x_g, npx_g) |&gt; \n  rename(xg = x_g) |&gt; \n  rename(xg_np = npx_g)\n\nxgmvp &lt;- vote |&gt; \n  select(player, x_g, npx_g) |&gt; \n  rename(xg = x_g) |&gt; \n  rename(xg_np = npx_g)\n\nxgmvp90 &lt;- vote |&gt; \n  select(player, x_g_2, npx_g_2) |&gt; \n  rename(xg90 = x_g_2) |&gt; \n  rename(xg_np90 = npx_g_2)\n\nxgmvp90long &lt;- xgmvp90 |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"xg\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\",\n    values_to=\"Metric\") \n\nxgmvplong &lt;- xgmvp |&gt; \n  pivot_longer(\n    cols=starts_with(\"xg\"), \n    names_to=\"Type\", \n    values_to=\"Metric\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=xgmvp, aes(x=reorder(player, xg), weight=xg), fill=\"darkred\") +\n  geom_bar(data=xgmvp, aes(x=reorder(player, xg_np), weight=xg_np), fill=\"darkgreen\") +\n  coord_flip()+\nlabs(\n    x=\"MVP Finalist\", \n    y=\"Season xG\", \n    title=\"Was Messi Helped Via Penalites?\", \n    subtitle=\"Did Messi &lt;span style = 'color:darkred;'&gt;rely on penalties&lt;/span&gt; or did he get opportunities &lt;span style = 'color:darkgreen;'&gt;in the run of play&lt;/span&gt;.\" , \n    caption=\"Source: Football Reference | Chase Ruch\",\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size=16)) +\n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  )\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSo, Messi is the second least reliant MVP candidate on penalties when it comes to getting xG opportunities during the entire season. What is not helping his case is that he has the second least xG for the entire season because his opponents played more competitions.\nTo level the playing field for the Argentine, we will go to xG per 90. This is where Messi’s MVP case begins to flourish.\n\n\nCode\nggplot() + \n  geom_bar(data=xgmvp90, aes(x=reorder(player, xg90), weight=xg90), fill=\"darkred\") +\n  geom_bar(data=xgmvp90, aes(x=reorder(player, xg_np90), weight=xg_np90), fill=\"darkgreen\") +\n  coord_flip() +\n  labs(\n    x=\"MVP Finalist\", \n    y=\"Per 90 xG\", \n    title=\"Did Messi Do Enough in Each Game?\", \n    subtitle=\"Messi only played 19 of 34 games, so did he dominate enough when he played?\", \n    caption=\"Source: Football Reference | Chase Ruch\",\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\"\n    ) +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size = 16))\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThere are three MLS MVP winners in the last decade to set the record for most points in a single season with their respective team. One of these players set this record along with the single season scoring record: Carlos Vela.\nIn 2019, Vela scored 34 goals in 33 appearances for LAFC. It would be unusual if he did not score in any given fixture.\nIf one were to raise the question of the greatest single season in MLS history, the measuring stick is Vela.\nBefore any rash assumptions are made, Messi did not have a better season than Vela because Messi is 13 goal contributions short (Vela also holds that record in a single season with 49). The question is did Messi have the pace that Vela did to potentially reach his mark if they matched in appearances.\nThe best statistic to measure this is a “goal creating action,” or GCA. A GCA credits a player for a shot, a dribble, a foul drawn, a clearance, or a tackle that leads to a goal. There are other specific circumstances that can credit a player with a GCA, but those are the most common scenarios.\n\n\nCode\nvela &lt;- read_csv(\"vela_match_logs_2019.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(Comp == \"MLS\") |&gt; \n  filter(Round == \"Regular Season\")\n\nmessi &lt;- read_csv(\"messi_2024_match_logs.csv\") |&gt; \n  filter(Comp == \"MLS\") |&gt; \n  filter(Round == \"Regular Season\")\n\nmessisum &lt;- messi |&gt; \n  mutate(cumgca = cumsum(GCA))\n\nmessiclean &lt;- messisum |&gt; \n  separate(Date, into=c(\"Year\", \"Date\"), sep=\"2024-\") |&gt; \n  separate(Date, into=c(\"Month\", \"Day\"), sep=\"-\")\n\nvelasum &lt;- vela |&gt; \n  mutate(cumgca = cumsum(GCA))\n\nvelaclean &lt;- velasum |&gt; \n  separate(Date, into=c(\"Year\", \"Date\"), sep=\"2019-\") |&gt; \n  separate(Date, into=c(\"Month\", \"Day\"), sep=\"-\")\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_step(data=messiclean, aes(x=Month, y=cumgca, group=Squad), color=\"#F7B5CD\", size=2) +\n  geom_step(data=velaclean, aes(x=Month, y=cumgca, group=Squad), color=\"#C39E6D\", size=2) +\n  labs(\n    x=\"Month\",\n    y=\"Cumulative Goal-Creating Actions\", \n    title=\"Messi Versus the Most Impressive MVP Season\", \n    subtitle=\"Did Messi have any pace to Carlos Vela's 2019 Season to match goal-creating actions?\", \n    caption=\"Source: Football Reference | By Chase Ruch\",\n    plot.title.position=\"plot\"\n    ) + \n  theme_minimal() +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=01, y=5, label=\"Messi\", color=\"#F7B5CD\", fontface=\"bold\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=02, y=7, label=\"Vela\", color=\"#C39E6D\", fontface=\"bold\") +\n  annotate(\"text\", x=6.5, y=10, label=\"Messi's Injury\", color=\"red\", fontface=\"bold\") +\n  theme(plot.title = element_text(face = \"bold\", size =16)) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 5.1) +\n  geom_vline(xintercept = 7.9)\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nThe crucial area to look at is Messi’s injury phase during the late summer to early fall. He had a better GCA pace than Vela.\nIt is not possible to be 100% sure that Messi would have a better season than the Mexican international, but it is valid to theorize that he had the pace to.\nAnother interesting piece to dwell on is the lull Vela had to end the season in terms of GCA. The season ended a bit earlier at the time, but a fully healthy Messi had a window to pounce on it.\nMessi also picked up where he left off as soon as he came back. He made it to within five GCAs.\nSo not only did Messi have MVP dominance among his candidate pool, he had pace to beating the best single MVP season in league history in some statistical areas. If one were a bettor that likes plus odds, the boy from Rosario, Argentina, is a solid take to one-up Vela’s record."

    "text": "Arne Slot, Liverpool’s first-year manager, broke Manchester City’s four-year Premier League title winning streak. The Dutch gaffer needed more than his tactical prowess to get his team to the crucial 82 points for the title.\nEgyptian winger Mohamed Salah struggled to find form at five total clubs over the span of seven years. He blossomed late in 2017 at Liverpool and never looked back.\nMohamed Salah, a two-time EPL winner and hoisted the UEFA Champions League trophy once, never came relatively close to a finalist position of the Ballon D’or. The trophy is decided yearly by the France Football magazine and is the most prestigious in world football in proclaiming the best player of the year.\nYear after year, the winger was exceptionally reliable in keeping Liverpool in the mix for both domestic and European title clashes. This year, though, Salah hit the highest gear of his entire professional career. As of the publishing of this article, he sits at a career high 46 goal contributions. Viewers expect him to notch a goal (and an assist) practically every game.\nThe Premier League is commonly the most competitive league in “the big five” European leagues. Teams generally stay within punching distance game in and game out. Lower level teams are not farmed of points from top level giants like Real Madrid, F.C. Barcelona, PSG and Bayern Munich.\nSo if the league is so competitive, Salah has to really stand out above the rest to gain traction to the coveted prize.\n\n\nCode\nlibrary(tidyverse)\nlibrary(worldfootballR)\n\nbig5_players &lt;- fb_big5_advanced_season_stats(season_end_year= c(2025), stat_type= \"standard\", team_or_player= \"player\")\n\nprem &lt;- big5_players |&gt; \n  filter(Comp == \"Premier League\")\n\npremscorers &lt;- prem |&gt; \n  filter(Gls &gt; 13)\n\nlibrary(ggalt)\nlibrary(ggtext)\n\nggplot() + \n  geom_dumbbell(\n    data=premscorers, \n    aes(y=reorder(Player, Gls_Per), x=Gls_Per, xend=xG_Per),\n    size = 3,\n    colour = \"grey\",\n    colour_x = \"green\",\n    colour_xend = \"blue\") +\n  theme_minimal() +\n  labs(\n    title=\"Mohamed Salah Performs Above his High Expectations\", \n    subtitle = \"The &lt;span style = 'color:green;'&gt;goals per 90 minutes&lt;/span&gt; on the right side indicates strong performance above his &lt;span style = 'color:blue;'&gt;xG per 90 minutes&lt;/span&gt;.\",\n    x=\"xG Per 90 v Goals Per 90\",\n    y=\"Top 10 EPL Goal Scorers\",\n    caption=\"By: Chase Ruch | Source: worldfootballR: The SportsDataverse's R Package for World Football Data\"\n  ) + \n  theme(\n    plot.subtitle = element_textbox_simple()\n  ) +\n  theme(\n    plot.title = element_text(size = 15, face = \"bold\"),\n    plot.title.position = \"plot\")\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nSalah is performing above the expectations of Erling Haaland when they both get their goal-scoring opportunities.

He also racks up assists and feeds players goals with high technical ability. \nBallon D’or is not for a few more months, but betting odds from all of the top sportsbooks already have a consensus top 10 to wager on.

In the 2017-18 season, the Premier League started to stat progressive carries, passes, and passes received. \nThese stats have complex metrics and computer programming to deem what is and is not progressive, but it is a very powerful tool in showing how a player can cause play to progress toward the opponent goal.

The margins are too significant for the media to bear ignorance to what continues to be a stunning year for the club legend.\nIt is up to a select tally when all is said and done, but one would be remiss if Salah did not get proper care and attention on the ballot."
